Example of a Reaper extension plugin that uses the JUCE library.

In Reaper it adds the following actions :

**"JUCE test : Show/hide XY Control"** : Shows/hides a window with tabbed XY controls to control track FX parameters in Reaper. Serves as a generic example of how to use the Reaper API together with JUCE components.

These are not fully developed features suitable for end users. (At least at the moment.)
